# Healthcare Information System

## Description
This Java Swing application, created for INFO 5100 â€“ Application Engineering Development (Fall 2023), is crafted to introduce students to the foundational concepts of Java classes, object-oriented programming, the Swing framework, and event handling. It showcases the transfer of data between Java Swing forms and objects, focusing on a healthcare information management context.

## Features
- **Create Person**: Implements a GUI to input personal details into a `Person` object with attributes such as name, SSN, website URL, email, picture, and more.
- **Create Address**: Facilitates the input of location details into an `Address` object, including GPS coordinates, city, state, and country.
- **Create Driver**: Captures driver's license information and stores it in a `Driver` object.
- **Create Vehicle Registration**: Records vehicle details like model and serial number into a `Vehicle Registration` object.
- **Create Patient**: Allows for the entry of patient information including patient ID, primary doctor, visit dates, allergies, medication status, and insurance coverage into a `Patient` object.
- **Create Doctor**: Saves a doctor's professional information in a `Doctor` object, detailing name, office address, doctor ID, specialty, and more.
- **Create Insurance Coverage**: Gathers insurance details and records them in an `Insurance` object, including corporate ID, address, premium, deductible, and a statement of benefits.
- **Display Patient Report**: Generates a detailed report displaying all the attributes entered, formatted for clarity and ease of understanding.
